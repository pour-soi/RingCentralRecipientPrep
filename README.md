# PourSend

PourSend is a local Windows desktop utility for organizing recipients, batch-importing phone numbers, and copying checked recipient numbers for use with RingCentral.

Current release: `v2.0.0`

The application does not send messages itself. You copy prepared recipient numbers from the app, paste them into RingCentral, and send manually.

This is an independent, unofficial utility and is not affiliated with or endorsed by RingCentral.

## Core Workflow

```text
Open app -> Choose a group or recipients -> Check recipients -> Copy numbers -> Paste into RingCentral -> Send manually
```

Batch import workflow:

```text
Copy many phone numbers -> Paste List -> Review preview -> Add All Recipients -> Select group -> Copy
```

Common workflows:

1. Add a phone number manually with **Add Recipient**.
2. Paste copied text with **Paste List**.
3. Import a TXT, CSV, or XLSX file with **Import File**.
4. Drag and drop a TXT, CSV, or XLSX file into the app.
5. Review the import preview before adding recipients.
6. Organize recipients by group.
7. Search and sort the current recipient list.
8. Check recipients to include them in checked-recipient actions.
9. Copy numbers for manual use in RingCentral.
10. Export recipient data to TXT, CSV, or XLSX.
11. Create and restore JSON backups.
12. Undo the most recent successful import when needed.

## Batch Import Behavior

Each valid phone number in a pasted batch becomes a separate recipient unless that normalized phone number already exists.

Names and surrounding labels in pasted or imported text are used only to help detect phone numbers. They are not saved as recipient identity.

During preview and import:

- Duplicate numbers inside the pasted batch are skipped.
- Phone numbers that already exist in the recipient list are skipped.
- Invalid phone numbers are skipped.
- Existing recipients are never overwritten.
- Existing legacy names are preserved for compatibility, but new recipient workflows do not require names.
- Only newly added recipients receive the selected batch group.

## Groups

A recipient belongs to one group. Records without a valid group fall back to `Default`.

Deleting a group does not delete the recipients inside it. It moves those recipients to `Default`.

You can open a group, search within that group, then select or deselect only the visible recipients in that group.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+V`: open Paste List when focus is not in a text field.
- `Ctrl+F`: focus the search field.
- `Ctrl+A`: check all visible recipients when focus is not in a text field.
- `Ctrl+Z`: undo the most recent successful import when focus is not in a text field.
- `Delete`: delete the selected recipient rows when focus is not in a text field.

## Privacy

- The application makes no network requests.
- No analytics are collected.
- No telemetry is collected.
- No cloud syncing is used.
- No contact syncing is used.
- There is no RingCentral API integration.
- There is no automatic message sending.

## Installation / Running From Source

On Windows:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

On macOS or Linux for development:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv

pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Portable Windows Build

This repository includes a manual GitHub Actions workflow that builds:

```text
PourSend-v2.0.0-Windows.zip
```

The zip contains `PourSend.exe`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE`.

To build it:

1. Open the repository on GitHub.
2. Go to **Actions**.
3. Select **Build PourSend Windows executable**.
4. Click **Run workflow**.
5. Run the workflow on `main`.
6. When it finishes, download the `PourSend-v2.0.0-Windows` artifact.
7. Extract `PourSend-v2.0.0-Windows.zip`.
8. Run `PourSend.exe`.

This is a portable executable, not an official signed installer.

## Testing

Run the automated test suite:

```powershell
python -m unittest
```

The current suite has 113 tests covering phone normalization, copy behavior, paste parsing, CSV detection, grouping, storage migration, batch phone-number import, search, sorting, phone display formatting, export formats, export scopes, backup import/export, shortcut safety, and release versioning.

## Data Location

The app tries to save recipients in:

```text
ringcentral_recipient_prep_data/recipients.json
```

next to the running app. If that location is not writable, it saves under the current Windows user profile.
